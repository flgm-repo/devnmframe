# Steps to follow in order for the application to work (May 10th)

**Settings-rails gem issue

  This gem is used to set some environment variables in the database and retrieve them in an easy way. In order for us to manage the variables, a file is stored in config/initializers/settings.rb which contains the set of variables used.
  When runing rake tasks, the file is loaded and a model Settings hasn't been created yet, so the rake tasks sometimes throws an error.
  In order for us to avoid this issue, just remove the file from the repo while you run rake tasks:
  
      rake gems:install
      rake db:create
      rake db:migrate

  Then restore it by runing:
  
      git checkout config/initializers/settings.rb
  
  Then do the last rake command:
  
      rake default:models <-- This rake task runs the code in lib/tasks/defaults.rake which sets the initial values to the database
      
** The Whenever gem

  Once all is running well, a task must be run in order for the application to remove old unused nameframes from the database. This daemon is run by the next command:
  
      whenever --update-crontab nameframe

Just in case you got an error from EY when cloning or re-deploying related to the "whenever"
